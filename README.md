# Bravery Network Online Team Randomizer

This is a team randomizer for Bravery Network Online, a competitive strategy RPG made by [Gloam](https://twitter.com/gloam_com). It creates a team with randomized fighters, necklaces, traits, focus, and moves. The plain text output can be copied and then imported using the game's team builder.

Currently the app is hosted [here](https://waasiq.herokuapp.com/randomizer.html).
