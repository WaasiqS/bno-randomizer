        <h1>Bravery Network Online Team Randomizer</h1>
        <p>This tool lets you make a randomized BNO team to play. Your fighters will be random, 
            as well as their traits, necklaces, focus, and moves. 
            <br/>
            If you're familiar with Challenge Cup or Random Battles on Pokemon simulators, it's similar to that.
            <br/>
            You can copy the text output and import it in the team builder.
            <br/><br/>
            Due to the nature of the confidence system, you might not be able to use the fighters
            as this tool gives them to you. You might need to change the fighter in the teambuilder so that
            you can actually use them. It might not be fully random but hopefully the randomizer can give you
            a good base to have some fun with.</p>

        <p>Options:</p>
        <form action="BNOTeam.php" method="GET" id="form1">
            <input type="checkbox" name="oneAttack"> One Attack: This guarantees that all fighters have at least one attacking move.
            <br/>
            <input type="checkbox" name="smartFocus"> Smart Focus: This guarantees that fighters don't have any wasted focus (e.g. PATK focus with no physical attacks).
            <br/>
        </form>
        
        <button class="button" form="form1" type="submit" value="Randomize">Randomize!</button>
